ABOUT

Fortran 90 OpenMP & MPI code to calculate Equation of State
of dense nuclear matter in Neutron Stars from Astronomical and Nuclear data.
Uses normal TOV equations, causality of adiabatic speed of sound and
stability against collapse into Black Hole.

Bayesian analysis and Markov chains are used.

Moreover it computes stellar binding energy, central number density,
tidal Love number and moment of inertia (including fraction in crust).

SETUP

Source files are located in src/ directory.
They can be compiled by compile.* files into
executables in main directory. See also
manulal.inf in doc/ for more details and instructions.
Briefly

src/ has Fortran 90 source files of the code.

doc/ has documentation and manual. Read it next.

DAT/ contains input data from observations and experiments,
as well as the theory.

my_prj/ has an example of project and using the code.

init/ has a few useful scripts.

run/ has examples of job submission on HPC machine Big Red II via TORQUE scripts.

knobs is a file needed to run calculations is project directory.

compile.* bash scripts to compile source code in defferent modes.

Read manual.inf in doc/ next.
